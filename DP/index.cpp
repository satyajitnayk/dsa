##Shortcut to write recursion for any problem:
1. Try to represent the problem in terms of index.
2. Do all possible stuffs on that index according to the problem statement.
3. a. Sum of all stuffs -> count all ways
   b. min(all stuffs) -> find min

**NOTE:
1. Top Down Approach => Bigger Problem to Smaller Problem (RECURSION)
1. Botto Up Approach => Smaller Problem to Bigger Problem (DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING)
