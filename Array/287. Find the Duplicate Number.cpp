Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer
 is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

Approach 1:store count & return where count > 1
time O(n) & Space O(1)
