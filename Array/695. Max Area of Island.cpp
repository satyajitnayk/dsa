You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's 
(representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) 
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

Approach 1:DFS 
1. The idea is to count the area of each island using dfs. 
2. During the dfs, we set the value of each point in the island to 0. 
=> Time complexity is O(mn).


CODE:
int maxAreaOfIsland(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int max_area = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++)
        for(int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++)
            if(grid[i][j] == 1)max_area = max(max_area, AreaOfIsland(grid, i, j));
    return max_area;
}

int AreaOfIsland(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int i, int j){
    if( i >= 0 && i < grid.size() && j >= 0 && j < grid[0].size() && grid[i][j] == 1){
        grid[i][j] = 0;
        return 1 + AreaOfIsland(grid, i+1, j) + AreaOfIsland(grid, i-1, j) + AreaOfIsland(grid, i, j-1) + AreaOfIsland(grid, i, j+1);
    }
    return 0;
}
